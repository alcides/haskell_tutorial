I don't want you to give up JS/Ruby/Python/Java/WTV and start using Python.

The goal is to take the good things of Haskell and use them in your language.



"Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will
have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better
programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp
itself a lot."

— Eric Raymond (on Lisp)

"Same applies for Haskel."

— Alcides Fonseca
