Great Things About Haskell:

If your function has more than 5 lines, it is wrong. (My experience)

If you code compiles, it will almost surely work. (Several personal experiences)

Speeds at the order of magnitude of C.

Hackage and Cabal (CPAN/RubyGems/PyPi for Haskell)

Hoogle (Try searching for "[a] -> [b]" or "Int -> Int")
